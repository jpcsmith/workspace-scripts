# Here,  you  can  specify the length of various dashes.  We sort the
# dash according to which type of characters that are on the left and
# right of it.  We are only conclusive if they are the same.
#
# We associate as follows:
#
#     Name        Type of character on each side
#     HyphDash    Alphabetic (foo-bar)
#     NumDash     Numeric (2--3)
#     WordDash    Space (like this --- see?)
#
# Below you specify how many dashes which are legal in each case.  We
# define 0 as  a magic constant which always generates an error.  You
# may specify more than one legal dash-length.
#
# Let's look at an example.  You use the following dash-syntax:
#
#     foo-bar
#     2--3
#     like this---see?
#
#
# HYPHDASH { 1 3 }        # Either a hyphen, or inter-word
# NUMDASH { 2 }           # Between words
# WORDDASH { 0 }          # We never use this
#

HyphDash { 1 }
NumDash { 2 }
WordDash { 1 2 }
